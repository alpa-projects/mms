# Beta: Statistical Multiplexing with Model Parallelism for Deep Learning Serving
This is the artifact for the paper "Beta: Statistical Multiplexing with Model Parallelism for Deep Learning Serving". We are going to reproduce the main results in the paper.

## Setup the environment
TODO @yinmin

## End-to-end Results (Sec 6.2, Figure. 11)
TODO @yinmin

## Serving Very Large Models (Sec 6.3, Figure. 12)


## Robustness to Changing Traffic Patterns (Sec 6.4, Figure 13)

## Ablation Study (Section 6.5, Figure 14)
Generate data into `sec6_5_data/ablation.tsv` (15 min)
```
bash gen_data_sec6_5_ab.sh
```
Plot figure `paper_figures/ablation.pdf`
```
python3 plot_sec6_5_ab.py --pdf
```

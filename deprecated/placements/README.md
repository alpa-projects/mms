# Placement File

Placement Files are saved/loaded in `alpasim/cluster.py`.

Currently the files in this folder are crafted by hand. They defines the placement policy for the load-balance demo.

Finally (not supported now) the placement files should be generated by the scheduling algorithm and fed into the simulator.

## Json File Format

Each element in the List defines a meshexecutor (a wrapper around model executable and meshgroup).

There are three key-value pairs in each element:

- model_name: defined in model_configs in model.py
- executable_name: defined in model_configs in model.py
- mesh_group: a list of meshes which defines the placement of the model executable, each mesh contains:
  - node_ids: list of node ids
  - devices: list of device list, the length must equal the length of node_ids

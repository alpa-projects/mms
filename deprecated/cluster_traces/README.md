# Cluster Trace

These trace files are generated by running the experiments on physical cluster, and serve as the ground truth to check the accuracy of the simulator.

## Json File Format

Example file:

```json
{
    "0": {                          // model_id
        "rq_id": [1, 3],            // request ids 
        "e2e_latency": [0.1, 0.1],  // end to end latency experienced by client (closed loop)
        "arrive": [0.1, 0.6],       // request arrival timestamp
        "stage_exec_info": [
            [
                [start, end, node_ids, devices]
                ...
            ], // stage one
            [
                [start, end, node_ids, devices]
                ...
            ], // stage two
        ]
    },
    "1": {
        ... ...
        ... ...
    }
}
```
